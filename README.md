## overview

The learning module is a list of solutions
for teaching new programmers how to write
code in a programming language, in this
case, it's written in `X`, it also includes
notes throughout the project to give further
information.

If you wanna learn some other language or add
more languages to your list then look around
for a learning module with the programming language
you wish to learn.
